# SSH Configuration

SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol for secure remote control of the server. Two access modes are available:

- Local network: direct connection via the local IP address
- External access: requires port forwarding on the internet router

While using a VPN is possible, SSH is preferred for its simplicity of setup. Exposing the service to the internet requires appropriate hardening.

## SSH Key Configuration

1. Generate an SSH key on the local machine:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "server-access"
   ```

   > **Security: always set a passphrase.** Without a passphrase, the private key is stored in plaintext on disk. If the client machine is stolen or compromised, an attacker can connect directly to the server. The passphrase encrypts the private key locally — even if the file is stolen, it is useless without it.
   > To add a passphrase to an existing key: `ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

2. Copy the key to the server:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id user_name@server
   ```

3. To avoid re-entering the passphrase on every connection, store it in a key manager:

   **macOS (Keychain + TouchID):**

   Add to `~/.ssh/config`:

   ```conf
   Host *
         AddKeysToAgent yes
         UseKeychain yes
   ```

   Then register the key in the Keychain:

   ```bash
   ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

   The passphrase will be automatically unlocked with the macOS session (TouchID / session password). Locked session = key inaccessible.

## Server Hardening

1. Edit the SSH configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/custom-config.conf
   ```

2. Add security parameters:

   ```conf
   LoginGraceTime 1m
   PermitRootLogin no
   MaxAuthTries 3
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   X11Forwarding no
   AllowUsers your_user

   # Once SSH key is tested, add:
   PasswordAuthentication no
   ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
   ```

3. Restart the SSH service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```

4. Test the key-based connection with `ssh user_name@server.local`.
5. After validating the connection, uncomment the last two lines and restart SSH.

## Simplified Connection

To avoid specifying the user on every connection, add to `~/.ssh/config`:

```conf
Host <hostname> <hostname>.local <public-domain> 64.64.31.31
      User user_name
```

The connection then becomes possible via:

```bash
ssh server.local
```

## Port 22 Forwarding

Once SSH is configured, port 22 must be forwarded on the router. Follow the procedure [here](./router-setup.md#port-forwarding) and ensure firewall rules allow access to port 22.

## Ollama Tunnel (Mac)

Exposes the Ollama instance running on a Mac (Apple Silicon) to the server's Open WebUI via a reverse SSH tunnel. The Mac's models appear in Open WebUI alongside the server's local models.

### Prerequisites

- The Mac must have SSH access to the server
- Ollama must be running on the Mac (port 11434)
- The **"Expose Ollama to the network"** option must be enabled in Ollama's settings. Without this option, Ollama rejects requests coming through the tunnel with a 403 error.

> **⚠️ Security warning**: enabling network access makes Ollama listen on **all network interfaces** of the Mac, including public Wi-Fi networks. Anyone on the same network can then access the Ollama API and:
>
> - use the Mac's CPU/GPU for their own prompts (compute theft)
> - list, delete, or inject models
>
> However, **Open WebUI conversations are not exposed**: Ollama is stateless, history is stored on the Open WebUI side on the Shuttle.
>
> **Why not better?** Ollama hardcodes accepted hosts (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`) in its anti-DNS-rebinding check on the HTTP `Host` header, and does not provide an environment variable to extend this list. `OLLAMA_ORIGINS` only controls CORS (browser `Origin` header), not this check. Clean alternatives (pf firewall, local mini proxy rewriting the `Host`) were ruled out due to their implementation and maintenance complexity.

### SSH Server Configuration

Add to the sshd config (e.g. `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):

```
GatewayPorts clientspecified
ClientAliveInterval 30
ClientAliveCountMax 3
```

- `GatewayPorts clientspecified`: allows the tunnel to bind on the Docker gateway IP (`DOCKER_GATEWAY_IP`), required for containers to access the tunnel
- `ClientAliveInterval/CountMax`: detects dead SSH clients in ~90s and releases the tunnel port. Without this, a sudden Mac disconnection (Wi-Fi drop, sleep) leaves a zombie session that blocks the port

Then restart sshd: `sudo systemctl restart sshd`

### Auto-start at Login

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama-tunnel.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.ollama-tunnel</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/usr/bin/ssh</string>
        <string>-N</string>
        <string>-o</string>
        <string>ServerAliveInterval=30</string>
        <string>-o</string>
        <string>ServerAliveCountMax=3</string>
        <string>-R</string>
        <string>DOCKER_GATEWAY_IP:11434:localhost:11434</string>
        <string>DOMAIN</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <true/>
    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/ollama-tunnel.log</string>
    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/tmp/ollama-tunnel.log</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

- `-N`: no remote shell, tunnel only
- `ServerAliveInterval/CountMax`: detects a dead connection in ~90s on the client side
- The tunnel binds on the Docker gateway IP to be accessible from containers
- `RunAtLoad` / `KeepAlive`: starts the tunnel at login and automatically restarts it if it dies — the native `ssh` binary is sufficient, no need for `autossh`

Replace `DOCKER_GATEWAY_IP` and `DOMAIN` with values from `.env`, then load the plist:

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama-tunnel.plist
```

`RunAtLoad: true` starts the tunnel immediately and `KeepAlive: true` restarts it automatically if it dies. The native `ssh` binary is sufficient: resilience is handled by launchd, no need for `autossh`.

### Updating or Disabling the Tunnel

`KeepAlive: true` makes `launchctl stop` ineffective: the process is immediately restarted. To modify the plist or disable the tunnel, use `unload`/`load`:

```bash
# Disable
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama-tunnel.plist

# Reload after modification
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama-tunnel.plist
```

### Verification

On the Mac: `launchctl list | grep ollama` should show a PID (1st column).

On the server: `ss -tlnp | grep 11434` should show the port listening.

From the Open WebUI interface, go to **Admin Panel → Settings → Connections**: both endpoints (`localhost:11434` and `${DOCKER_GATEWAY_IP}:11434`) should appear with a green status.
